This paper presents the architecture, implementation and evaluation of IFTD, a multiprotocol data transfer service.  The architecture allows a single implementation of a data transfer protocol to be used by any local application for its data transfer needs.  This way, IFTD separates the development of application logic from data transfer logic, allowing application developers to avoid re-implementing data transfer protocols for each additional application.  Also, applications that use IFTD will immediately benefit from additional data transfer protocols added to it.

This paper first provides an argument for the design considerations and requirements for creating IFTD based upon common features of real-world data transfer scenarios.  It then gives a discription of how IFTD meets these requirements, and then assesses its effectiveness at performing data transfers in a series of four performance evaluations with respect to the performances of existing data transfer software.  Finally, it discusses additional considerations that may be used to algorithmically determine the best data transfer protocol for given data and a given transfer history.
