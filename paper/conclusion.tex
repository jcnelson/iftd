\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented the design and implementation of a prototype data transfer service that decouples an application from data transmission.  The prototype implementation IFTD provides a protocol architecture that allows for arbitrarily complex data transmission schemes and automatically makes every protocol it uses resumable.  It also remembers each data transfer it performs so it can intelligently choose which protocols to use based not only on the capabilities of the remote hosts it engages, but also based on the properties of the data itself.  Additionally, IFTD can use existing data transfer services to perform a data transfer, allowing it to be incrementally deployed.  Applications using IFTD do not need to implement protocol-specific content negotiation, data transmission, or error handling logic in order to perform data transfers.

This paper also presented a set of four simple performance evaluations of IFTD.  While using IFTD adds transfer overhead, its automatic protocol resumability allows it to avoid re-transferring data it has already received, as well as tolerate multiple fatal protocol errors.  Additionally, it has been shown to correctly identify the protocol with the highest bandwidth over time with successive data transfers.  While the evaluations were limited in scope, the results indicate that pursuing further development and experimentation with IFTD is a worthwhile endeavor.
